        <h3>I was born in Iran in 1976 in an educated family. My dad was an English instructor working in several institutions and colleges and had a bachelor’s degree in English Linguistics. My mother, by the way, was a university graduate in French Language, teaching in high school. My sister was studying as a pharmacist and my brother as a civil drafter. I was grown up in a “learning” family and got used to continue this attire for my whole life. As I entered high school, I felt I had a passion for aviation, basically, as a pilot. Due to high pilot training expenses and since my family was not able to afford, I decided to join aviation in any possible way.
        <h3> After finishing high school, I continued my higher education in aircraft maintenance engineering which enabled me to get into my desired field. I was one of the best students at college and graduated with distinction by the end of a four-year contribution. Despite of difficult situation for graduates to be employed in aircraft engineering, I got hired by one of my favorite airlines at that time which helped me grow technically and practically. I got better familiar with relevant documentation and rules which were not focused explicitly in theoretical classes.</h3>
        <h3>I stayed in my role and grew as a licensed engineer supervising crews to carry out aircraft maintenance tasks. I gathered a lot of useful experience and this helped me join my next destination, Gulf Air, which needed engineers to look after their planes in their outstation, Iran capital city, Tehran. I was sent to Bahrain for an intensive three-month course that was a valuable experience as I studied overseas and visited several high-level people in the company. The company stopped operation in Iran and all employees, including me, were transferred to Qatar Airways, which is a well-known airline globally with high ranking in all the aspects of aviation industry. That was a challenging role out there as I was about to compete for the position because there are many people fighting for getting hired as aircraft engineers in Qatar Airways. </h3> 
        <h3> After a while, I decided to pave my way to live and work in Qatar, but that was not successful. In 2012, I packed up to move to Australia to explore and experience a totally different life. Two months after my arrival in Melbourne, I was offered a position at Qantas in Brisbane. I started my job in my new host company and worked for two years. Then, I decided to experience the lifestyle in the States. I travelled to the States in 2015, but I did not find it a place for me and my family. By the way, I visited a few people worked as IT professionals there which exposed me to research about IT field and its subcategories.</h3>
        <h3>That was the start of my journey to Information Technology area which created another field of interest. After returning to Australia, I started to research about my favorite IT branches and found Cloud computing, exclusively AWS platform, as the best option to take. I started self-studies and obtained AWS Cloud Practitioner Certificate in 2019. At that time, I got aware of my capabilities to move onto another field, and that was the starting point where I enrolled in the Cloud Technology course at the La Trobe University. I finished the first term with the average score of %85, which looks decent for a totally newcomer to the IT field. It did not quite attract me, but I found one of the subjects very interesting: <i>Web Development</i>. I cancelled the enrolment at the bachelor level course and since then, I have been choosing to learn and develop skills in the web development and pursuing my passion by enrolling in multiple courses on Udemy and other learning platforms. Despite my work commitments at Jetstar and later at Qantas, I have been studying any time I have been able to and learning more and more.</h3>

        <h3>I love travelling and it is my first favorite hobby. I have been to Dubai over ten times and I feel it has still many things to explore and offer to visitors. I also visited Tunisia once where I found it a great historical adventure because it is linked to centuries ago when French civilization captured it and conveyed the language as well as historical footprints. The Tunisians speak a language like mixed Arabic-French which is amazing. I have also been to the Netherlands, as part of my professional requirement, and it attracted me a lot because of cultural differences and natural attractions. Turkey is also in my favorite lists primarily due to its rich culture as well as its vicinity to my country’s ex-culture. I can also add some other places such as The State of Qatar and Bahrain which was an amazing adventure. My second interest is learning different languages; I know a bit of Russian, Dutch and French which I learned simply by self-learning .My ever-lasting interest, however, is learning computer subjects, especially, the ones related to programming and development. I am enrolled in several courses on Udemy for diverse subjects such as python, java, SQL, C#, React, Angular and Vue.js. I am touching them every often when I have time to do so! </h3>
